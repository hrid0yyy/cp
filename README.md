## About

This repo serves as our personal archive for competitive programming solutions. Problems are sourced from platforms like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com/), and others.





- `templates/` contains useful C++ templates (e.g., for fast I/O, segment trees, etc.).

## How to Run Code

1. Make sure you have **C++ (GCC/G++)** installed on your system.
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall filename.cpp -o output
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
